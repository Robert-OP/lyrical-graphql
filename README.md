# Lyrical GraphQL & React App

## [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) + [Express](https://expressjs.com/) + [React](https://reactjs.org/)

- structuring GraphQL servers
- building flexible data schemas
- single page applications with React JS and GraphQL
- [GraphiQL](https://graphql.org/learn/serving-over-http/#graphiql) - really nice dev tool when working with GraphQL, allows to make queries against server on localhost:4000/graphql

### good luck & have fun !
